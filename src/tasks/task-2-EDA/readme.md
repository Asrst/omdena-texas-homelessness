# Task-2-EDA
## Resources
* app.py is designed for you to be able to do base-line data preprocessing and cleaning. Please let me know if you have any other suggestions on what we should do to add to this file as the collaborative effort on this is key to our success.
* Notebook Folder
  * This folder holds my initial exploratory notebooks with some key visuals to help you get started on a few different questions as you work to develop your own. 
  * These notebooks were built using some of the datasets already located within our Google Drive Doc as well as the Data Folder of this Git Repo. 
  * I hope you can build upon these visuals as well as you progress through your data exploration.
* Projects Tab
  * Has tasks in the form of "Notes" that you can grab, drag, and drop in different lists, as well as iterate over with your work completed
  * This is a great way for us to also keep track of contributions!
