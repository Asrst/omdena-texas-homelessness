# Notebooks
## Which Notebook goes to which DataSet?
The Notebooks are as follows:
* [needs_met_by_outreach_teams.ipynb](https://github.com/OmdenaAI/omdena-texas-homelessness/blob/main/src/tasks/task-2-EDA/notebooks/needs_met_by_outreach_teams.ipynb) links to the DataSet [Needs Met by Homeless Outreach Street Team](https://github.com/OmdenaAI/omdena-texas-homelessness/blob/main/src/data/Needs_met_by_Homeless_Outreach_Street_Team.csv)
* [return_to_homelessness.ipynb](https://github.com/OmdenaAI/omdena-texas-homelessness/blob/main/src/tasks/task-2-EDA/notebooks/return_to_homelessness.ipynb) links to the DataSet [Strategic Measure Number of Returns to Homelessness](https://github.com/OmdenaAI/omdena-texas-homelessness/blob/main/src/data/Strategic_Measure_Number_of_returns_to_homelessness.csv)

## Why are these here?
The purpose of these Notebooks is to serve as a foundation for you to begin EDA. In each of these notebooks, I pose some simple questions to get your mind moving around the data. I produce some visualizations that serve to help you grasp the data, so you can turn around and do proper EDA with these DataSets. I really look forward to what everyone can create!
