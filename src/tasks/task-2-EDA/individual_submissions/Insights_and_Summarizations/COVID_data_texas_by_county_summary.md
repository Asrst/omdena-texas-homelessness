# Brief Description
This dataset focuses on healthcare subsection COVID-19 in Texas by County. This is some great and important data to see how COVID-19 has affected Texas as a State, how the rates in homelessness have increased in areas with higher infection rates, etc. This data is extremely useful for all aspects. Data covers over 03-2020 through 09-2021.

## Categories Covered
Dataset covers over healthcare subsection COVID-19 case count data

## How would you recommend usage?
This data will work well in any situation, but can be best used with data on rates of homelessness in the same time period to see the progession of both and the correlated affects it has.

## What insights were you hoping to glean from the data?
I wanted to find out how it is that COVID-19 rates have increased/decreased over time. I wanted to see how the data per County breaks down and find why the Counties with lower rates had those. Were they sparsely populated? Were there different actions taken by local government that allowed this? Could we find it in the data?

## What were the key takeaways that the data gave you?
I learned about how COVID affected every part of texas over the course of time. I learned that the data could provide invaluable insights into the rest of the categories we have in the task as well.

## How have the visualizations given you a better insight into the data?
Using the cloropleth mapping that Team-3 was able to create for other aspects of Texas, we could compare and understand the insights we were seeking to begin with.
