## Brief Description
This dataset is focused on actions taken by different "forces" that deal with housing, employment, and healthcare and whether these actions were direct or indirect in their targeting of homelessness. This dataset offers many key features and can easily be paired with data for rates of homelessness, employment opportuinities, and healthcare to give us an even better insight into how these actions directly affect these different factors. The data fits well inside of a Random Forest Classifier and attains a 90% Validation accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning could see this better, and if paired with other data, neural networks would be able to use this data too.

## Categories Covered
Dataset covers housing, employment, and healthcare, but indirectly

## How would you recommend usage?
This dataset can be used on it's own as a predictor as to whether an action taken by a specified "force" would be directly targeted at homelessness or not. This can be used in conjunction with other data over housing, employment, and healthcare to give an even better insight into how those actions in turn affect the populous.

## What insights were you hoping to glean from this data?
I wanted to learn how probable is it that an action taken would be targeted at homelessness. From there, I wanted to learn if that action would be direct or not.

## What were the key take-aways the data gave you?
We learned that the probability of an action being taken towards homelessness is extremely low at 8.5% while the probability of the action taken being directly targeted given that the action is targeted at homelessness was about 26.09%.

## How have the visualizations given you a better insight into the data?
Visualizations have shown the distribution of data and how each of the different features correlate to one another.
