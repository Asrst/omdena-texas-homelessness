# Unequal Financial Impacts of the Pandemic by Quarter:
# Git Link to DataSet
Dataset is located [here](https://github.com/OmdenaAI/omdena-texas-homelessness/blob/main/src/data/employment/Unequal%20Financial%20Impacts%20of%20the%20Pandemic%20(HPS)%20by%20Quarter.xlsx%20-%20Sheet1.csv)
## Brief Description
This dataset focuses on the employment opportunities aspect of our three categories. When looking over this data, I wanted to find any information that I could about how the pandemic has affected employment opportunites. However, upon loading in the dataset, the information is too spread out and improperly input. Columns in rows, rows in columns, no real understanding of the data or what we are looking at... Due to this, it is my recommendation that this data be saved and passed on, but not used by us. If you can find a use for the data though, I would recommend it. If we could figure out how this is all supposed to be laid out, we could gain some valuable insights into this set. It is just not worth the investment vs return.
