## Breif Description
This dataset focuses on total COVID-19 case counts in every county with confirmed cases, possible cases, and fatalities. This data started off with outliers in the data that caused great issues when trying to process. Looking over visuals of the data and parsing down by 20 Counties, we were able to get much better distribution and work with data that could be generalized. 

## Categories Covered
This dataset covers Healthcare subsection COVID-19

## How would you recommend usage?
I would recommend using this dataset with others related to COVID-19 to provide better insight into this factor as a whole. Then it can be used with the other two categories to show more of how COVID-19 has affected the rise in homelessness rates and how actions taken have impacted this.

## What insights were you hoping to glean from the data?
I wanted to learn about how confirmed cases factors into fatalites and how probable cases correlates with confirmed cases

## What were the take-aways that the data gave you?
I learned about how fatalities and confirmed cases follow a linear relationship of positive correlation. The more people who are sick, the more likely people are to die. When we have lower infection rates, we see less lives lost.

# How have the visualizations given you a better insight into the data?
!['confirmed_cases_vs_fatalities']("C:\Users\Alex Lucchesi\OneDrive\Pictures\Omdena Project Photos\COVID case count confirmed_fatalities.png")
Visualizations have given us the ability to see the relationship between the data and how it follows a linear fashion.
