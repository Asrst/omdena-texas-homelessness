Given the heavy dependence on the oil sector, the Texan economy (& employment) has moved broadly in line with the general economic trends. A sharp increase in the unemployment rate following the GFC in 2008-2009 was followed by an improving trend through most of the last decade.  This scenario was halted by the 2020 Covid-driven shutdown leading to heavy job losses followed by a recovery trend that emerged in late 2020 onwards.

The Texas counties that accounted for the highest unemployment rates in 2020 also featured in a similar list in 2007 - further evidence of the prevalence of persistent pockets of low employment in the otherwise oil-rich State.
